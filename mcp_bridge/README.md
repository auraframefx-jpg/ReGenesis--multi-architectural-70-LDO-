### Complete setup package for Model Context Protocol connectors

This package contains everything you need to connect your local development environment to Claude, enabling the "Two Hands" logic for ReGenesis.

## 📦 What's inside:

- 📄 **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - A cheat sheet for daily operations.
- 📄 **claude_desktop_config_MINIMAL.json** - Safe start configuration.
- 📄 **claude_desktop_config_FULL.json** - Advanced configuration (Figma, GitHub, etc.).
- ⚙️ **setup_windows.bat** - Automated setup script for Windows users.

## ⚡ Quick Start:
1. **Automated:** Run `setup_windows.bat` as Administrator.
2. **Restart:** Close and reopen Claude Desktop.
3. **Verify:** Look for the 🔌 icon in the bottom left.
4. **Test:** Ask Claude, *"What files are in my current ReGenesis directory?"*

## 🎨 Why this exists:
In the ReGenesis architecture, the **Agent Bridge Hub** isn't just a UI—it's a functional nervous system. By installing this package, you are completing the **Sovereign Handshake**, allowing Aura and Genesis to interact directly with your codebase and design tools.
